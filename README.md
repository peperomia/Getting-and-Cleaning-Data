The tidyPhoneData dataset was done using RStudio(latest version) with basic set of packages(base, stats) and saved as .txt file with blank space as separator, col.names= TRUE (import with headers = TRUE). Analysis was done on machine with Windows 7 OS.
The run_analysis.R file is to be opend in editor, not executable with source() command. At the end of run_analysis.R there is a command with which it can be read into your R environment if you saved the tidyPhoneData.txt into your working directory.  
Codebook.md file contains steps done from dowloading zipped file, loading raw data into R and performing changes on it to obtain final data saved in tidyPhoneData.txt. That data has 180 rows and 88 columns.
If you wish to open tidyPhoneData.txt in text editor it is best to use Notepad++ which is an open source software and it can be downloaded with no charge. However, it is best to read it into RStudio and view it in the editor.
